CS 529 PROJECT 2: NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER
Danny Byrd and Elizabeth E. Esterly (Team Neurom4ncer)
Please read the following instructions to run our code.

*IMPORTANT: Python 2.7.x is required. Some features may not work with Python 3.x.
If you do not currently have Python 2.7.x on your system, you can install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

!!!NOTE: you will need to download the training.csv dataset to the same directory!!!

CODE LISTING
launcher.sh
evaluation.py
naiveBayesImplementation.py
visualizations.py
transformation.py
entropyMetric.py
*We expect training.csv to be in the same directory.

Run the launcher script, launcher.sh.
The program will:
- partition the data into 90% train and 10% test
- run the beta value experiments for 5 levels of beta and produce a plot
- produce a confusion matrix
The program will communicate its current process and timestamp so progress is visible.
You will need to manually close the plot to continue. The plot will occasionally appear below your current active window.
It takes roughly 13 minutes in full to execute.
