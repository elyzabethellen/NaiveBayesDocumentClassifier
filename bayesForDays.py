### read in the training data? or process online? Probably the latter this file is huge (1.5 G)

###create a matrix here: read in labels text file and index accordingly
# maybe good to store a dictionary of label:index

###how many times have we seen this word and class combo
##i.e. position 12 (M) in training.csv == "of" and we see that occur in each training data point, often multiple times.
##pos 23 (X) == "and", same deal

#column # 61190 contains the label, from 1 -20
